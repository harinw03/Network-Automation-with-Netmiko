 Why automation in networking? When you have hundreads of devices and you need a centralized management which makes your life easy. 
 Network engineer never had this freedom what IT Admin with Active Directory or a Devops engineer with chef,puppet,salt.
 As we know networking have multi vendor devices with differnt OS. For an example Cisco commands are different between ASA,NX-OS,IOS. 
 Automation will help you manage all the devices in your org effectively. Automation is not just about scripting, its also how we make 
 use of automation tools like Ansible, Jenkins, Git etc.

There are many use cases, I have mentioned few below.
1) Disconnect/block a user from wifi.
2) Block a LAN port where mac add 'XYZ' is connected.
3) Auto config backup of devices.
4) Updated the OS for a group swithes.
5) Zero touch implementation for a new office. 
So on.
